Stable Matching Algorithm

Implements a variation of the stable marriage problem, where program determines
maximum weight matchings of vertices in a convex bipartite graph.

Input Block Format: Each input block species a CBG G = (U; V ). The rst line of an input block
contains two integers m and n that specify jUj and jV j, respectively. Each of the next m lines contains four
integers specifying the four components of a tic in U. After these m lines, each of the next n lines contains
two integers specifying the two components of a tac in V .
