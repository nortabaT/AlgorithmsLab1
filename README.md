**Stable Matching Algorithm**

*Implements a variation of the stable marriage problem, where program determines
maximum cardinality maximum weight matchings (MWMCMs) of vertices in a convex bipartite graph.*

**Input Block Format:** Each input block specifes a Convex Bipartite Graph, G = (U; V). The first line of an input block
contains two integers m and n that specify |U| and |V|, respectively. Each of the next m lines contains four
integers specifying the four components of a tic in U. After these m lines, each of the next n lines contains
two integers specifying the two components of a tac in V.
